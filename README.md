## Hey There! 👋 I'm KronsyC

### Student, Programmer

#### I love programming and hope to go to college to study software engineering after high school. I primarily work as a full-stack developer, but really love distributed systems and have a bias towards the backend. I enjoy learning about distributed design methodologies such as microservices and one day, hope to make these technologies better.

### What I Can Do
- 🖥️ NodeJS ( Express, Fastify )
- 🐍 Python ( Flask, Fastapi )
- 🌐 Frontend ( React, Gatsby, Next )
- DevOps ( Docker, Kubernetes )
- C#
- Golang
- Databases ( MongoDB, SQL(Postgres) )

## Projects
#### I Love development and working on projects, most of them get scrapped but here are a few that I have published
- ### URL Shortening Application **[Teenie](https://teenie.ml)**
  #### This app has a simple GUI and is still in development, but it does its job.
  ![Teenie GUI Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KronsyC/KronsyC/main/Teenie.png)
  ##### The GUI is written in React, with a fastify backend. I use MongoDB as a data store.
  ##### I love Cloudflare for caching content, so the domain is proxied through Cloudflare to increase loading speeds
