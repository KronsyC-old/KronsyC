## Hey There! 👋 I'm Samir, aka. KronsyC

### Student, Programmer

#### I love programming and hope to go to college to study software engineering after high school. I primarily work as a full-stack developer, but really love distributed systems and have a bias towards the backend. I enjoy learning about distributed design methodologies such as microservices and one day, hope to make these technologies better.

### What I Can Do
- 🖥️ NodeJS ( Express, Fastify, Nestjs )
- 🐍 Python ( Flask, Fastapi )
- 🌐 Frontend ( React, Gatsby, Next, Vue, Angular )
- DevOps ( Docker, Kubernetes )
- C#
- Golang
- Databases ( MongoDB, Postgres, Firebase )
